# Realtime Temperature Monitoring
Realtime Temperature Monitoring on Raspberry Pi 3 with DS18B20 Kit by Go Fiber and NextJS Static.
This project run on high performance Go Fiber and serve static files which export from NextJS.

### Go Fiber features could make the great projects.
- Express-inspired
- Robust routing
- Serve static files
- Extreme performance
- API ready
- Flexible middleware support
- Low memory footprint
- Template engine
- Websocket support
- Rate limiter

### Project Components
1. Raspberry Pi 3
2. DS18B20 Kit
3. NodeJS (This project Node version 18.4.0)
4. Go 1.18.3

### Running and Developing on Raspberry Pi 3
1. Clone the repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/openmymai/Tempmon.git
```
2. Build Go at Root, it will build binary executable file
```
$ go build
```
3. In nextjs directory, install dependencies and export to static file
```
$ npm install && npm run export
```
4. Run the project
```
$ ./<binary_file>
```
5. Use Systemd to start service at startup by create temp.service in /lib/systemd/system/temp.service
```
